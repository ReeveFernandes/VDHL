This is a README file explaining all the folders in the FernandesReeve/Handover directory.

Summary of work:
My work revolves around learning how to code in FPGA in hardware to run real time logic. The research,
documetation, and projects are based on three purchased board (Please refer to Hardware Documentation file for 
details on the kits): Arduino Uno (Board Kit 1), MKR VIDORD 4000 FPGA Development board (Board Kit 2), OMDAZZ Cyclone IV FPGA Development
Board (Board Kit 3). Plans and presentation of the plans are in the the plans and presentation folder respectvely. The research
conducted for possible board purchases are enclosed in the Research Folder.
The files in the demonstration file are related to projects made during the demonstration period on Arduino's
MKR VIDOR 4000 FPGA Development board. Some of the projects related to the MKR VIDOR 4000 are in the VHDL-1
folder.
The files that are related to the OMDAZZ Cyclone IV FPGA Development board are in Documentation folder - which 
has the documentation related to board that were used in the projects in VHDL-1 folder.


Folder Description:
Demonstration - Folders of projects and documentation and results used before, during, and after the
		demonstration period. These files mostly pertain to the old small blue FPGA from arduino
		aka MKR VIDOR 4000. This folder contains Verilog/VHDL code for projects related to video
		processing pipeline in the /pipeline directory.

Docs - List of work related documents

Documentation - Documentations for TFT Screen in the OMDAZZ FPGA Development kit

Invoice - Invoice and reimbursement related documents

Plans - Plans for work during my time at GENISAMA

Presentation - Presentation for understanding tasks undertaken at my time in GENISAMA

Research - all the spreadsheet containing the intel and Xilinx FPGA Development boards and chips

VHDL - 1 : collection of VHDL/Verilog Projects on the OMDAZ board/ MKR VIDOR 4000 board
