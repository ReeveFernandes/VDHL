## Demonstration
This folder contains projects, documentation, and results related to the following FPGA boards:
- MKR VIDOR 4000 (kit 2): Worked on creating a video processing pipeline using Verilog/VHDL code.
- Intel DE10-Nano FPGA: Explored additional FPGA-based projects, focusing on video and hardware processing.

The projects primarily involved developing Verilog/VHDL code for video processing pipelines with HDMI output.

## VHDL - 1
Contains Verilog code for the image processing pipeline for the MKR VIDOR 4000 FPGA. The goal was to create a video processing pipeline using the FPGA for HDMI screen output. While the attempt was not successful due to code discrepancies, the files include adaptations of various open-source projects.
