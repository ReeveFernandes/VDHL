Syntax:

process_name : process (sensitivity_list)
	
	-- Declarative Section   		//list of signals // only simulation
						// waits for any of the siganals above to change
begin

	--Body Section

end process;



Example:


TestProcess1: process (Sig1)
begin
	sig2 <= sig1;
end process;

AND_GATE : process(A,B)
begin
	C <= A and B;
end process;


Registered prcoess: // must have clk signal and reag the edges of the singal. Better to have reset


TestPricess : process(rst, Clk)
begin
	if Rst = '1' then
		Q <='0'
	elif rising_edge(clk) then
		q <= D;
	end if
end process;
